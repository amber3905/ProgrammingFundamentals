# Programming Fundamentals

## Description
This project contains a series of Java applications developed during the Programming Fundamentals module at the University of Surrey. It demonstrates key programming concepts including object-oriented programming (OOP), arrays, loops, conditional statements, file I/O, exception handling, and data structures (lists, maps).

## Technologies
- Java
- Eclipse IDE
- Git/GitHub

## Features
- Implemented classes and objects with complex fields
- Used loops and nested loops with arrays for calculations
- Applied regular expressions and exception handling
- Converted UML diagrams into Java code
- Practiced file reading and writing with Java I/O

## How to Run
1. Open the project in Eclipse or your preferred IDE.
2. Compile and run the Java files individually.
3. Follow the in-code instructions to test each application.
